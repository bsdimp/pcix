== Reverse Engineering AIX Dump/restore format

This document describes the format used to distribute PC/IX floppies for the
PC/IX 1.0 release.

=== Background

This section has background for why I'm doing this, how I'm doing things, etc.

==== You're doing what?

Recently, I've written a vm86-based program to execute Venix/86 (and maybe Venix/286) binaries.
These a.out-formatted executables come in two flavor that are approximately the 'tiny' and 'small' memory models to use the older venacular.
This got me thinking about the general problem of emulating old 8086 binaries using VM86.

In the course of doing this, someone has asked me how I'd extend this to other older PC Unixes.
I didn't have a good answer, so I thought I'd see if I could access PC/IX disks.
There's a PC Emulator called pce that distributes several old OSes for 8088/8086 era machines, one of which is PC/IX 1.0.
Looking at those disks, I see they are in AIX dump / restore format.
Hence my desire to reverse engineer the format so I could extract the files more easily.
Unlike the PDP-11 emulators, there's no good way to export a tree of files form this, so I thought I'd basically write `tar` for this format.
There's likely some trick to this I've not encountered yet, but this was a fun project.

==== Where to start?
I opened all the PC/IX disks up in emacs to browse through them (doesn't everybody?).
I was looking for PC/IX's u area to compare it with the V7 u-area and the Venix u-area (which were different from each other and from pc/ix).
It turns out there's no separate u-area: It's been merged into the proc structure for each proc in the system.
In the course of doing this, I discovered a file called 'dumprestor.h'.

[source,C]
----
/*
 * @(#)dumprestor.h	5.4 - 10/17/83
 */
----

That has the basics of this format, but it wasn't enough for a quick program to extract.
So I thought I'd walk through what I've learned.
Some of it is trivial, other bits useful to understanding the format.

==== Dump and restor?

There were programs by that name on V7 unix, could this format just be that by another name?

} spcl;

.PC/ix dumprestore.h

...
/* max number of blocks in a tape record */
#ifdef  idea
#define NTREC           (4096/BSIZE)    /* drive can't handle that much  */
#else
#define NTREC           (10240/BSIZE)   /* blocking factor - 10240 bytes */
#endif
/*
 *      bitmap parameters.
 *      note: 8K * 8 == 64K, largest possible inumber
 */
#define MLEN             8              /* number of bits per map word   */
#define MSIZ            (8*1024)        /* number of words in map        */
...
#define MAGIC           (int)60011      /* magic number for headers      */
#define CHECKSUM        (int)84446      /* checksum for all headers      */
...
union fs_rec {

	/* common fields */
	struct hdr h;

	/* FS_VOLUME -- begins each volume */
	struct fs_volume v;
...
};
----

So while they share similar bits, they are clearly going to be different.
And experience bears this out.
Though they have the same magic number, it's located at a different offset in the file so file(8) can tell the V7 dumps apart from the AIX dumps.

== The Format
I only have examples of these disks. I have no other examples to go by. I jotting down these notes while I write my extraction program.

=== Basic Layout

The basic layout is documented in the header file, but key details are missing.

.Layout
[source,C]
----
 * format of inode dump
 *      FS_VOLUME
 *      FS_CLRI         (if incremental)
 *              list of inodes unallocated at time of dump
 *
 *      FS_BITS         (just before the first FS_INODE header on each vol.)
 *              list of files on this and succeeding volumes
 *
 *      FS_FINDEX
 *              index of files on this volume.  the last file or two
 *              may not be indexed, for space reasons.  the link field
 *              gives the address of the next FS_INDEX on this volume.
 *
 *      FS_INODE        (before each file)
 *      file data
 *      FS_END or FS_VOLEND
 *
 * format of name dump:
 *      FS_VOLUME
 *      FS_NAME         (before each file)
 *      file data
 *      FS_END
----

So there's two types of dump. In fact, the diskettes seem to have both types, so we'll start to take a look from there.

However, key details like what happens at the end of each volumn, how do we map inodes to names, etc are missing.

If you examine the text part of disk11.img and the first part of disk12.img, you'll see proc.h spans the end of one and the start of the next.
However, you'll also see there's a bunch of NULs after the text on disk11.img.
So all the lengths in this file are specified in 'dword' which is 8 bytes long.
So, the volume header above is 9 * 8 = 72 bytes long.
You'll also see that there's 72 bytes of header before the text file cotninues where it left off on disk11.img.
The first 09 in disk12.img says the header is 72 bytes long.
The end of disk11.img takes a little more digging.
If we look at the header if disk11.img, you'll see this:

.disk11.img headers
[source]
----
{
	h {
		len = 9 '\t',
		type = 0 '\000',
		magic = 60011,
		checksum = 62350
	},
	volnum = 2,
	date = 446594393,
	ddate = 446594393,
	numwds = 38592,
	disk = '\000' <repeats 15 times>,
	fsname = "unknown\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000", 
	user = "root", '\000' <repeats 11 times>,
	incno = 100
}
----

And the volume is 38592 words or 308736 bytes long (0x4B600), which corresponds to the hexdump line above where the zeros start.
The volume header tells you how much data is valid (which happens to be weirly less than the floppy length, maybe so if it were a file, it would fit on a freshly formatted 320k floppy).
